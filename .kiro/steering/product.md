## Planned

TTS synthesis, email intelligence, calendar prioritization, adaptive learning, smart home integration.

## Philosophy

**Greenfield Project**: Breaking changes are acceptable. Prioritize clean design, performance, and maintainability over backwards compatibility.

**TDD Mandate**: Write tests first (Red-Green-Refactor). 90% coverage minimum, 100% for critical paths. Monthly dead code cleanup.

**Extensibility**: Plugin-style architecture with abstract interfaces for future AI workflows (embeddings, response generation, TTS).

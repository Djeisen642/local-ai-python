# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds audio noise filtering and enhancement capabilities to the local AI speech-to-text system to improve transcription accuracy by reducing background noise, echo, and other audio artifacts before processing with the Whisper model.

## Glossary

- **Audio_Filter_System**: The noise filtering and audio enhancement component
- **Noise_Reduction_Engine**: The core algorithm that removes unwanted audio artifacts
- **Audio_Enhancement_Pipeline**: The processing chain that applies multiple filters sequentially
- **Spectral_Subtraction**: A noise reduction technique that removes noise based on frequency analysis
- **Wiener_Filter**: An adaptive filter that reduces noise while preserving speech characteristics
- **High_Pass_Filter**: A filter that removes low-frequency noise like rumble and hum
- **Normalization_Engine**: Component that adjusts audio levels for optimal processing

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want background noise to be automatically filtered from my microphone input, so that transcription accuracy improves in noisy environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I speak in an environment with background noise, THE Audio_Filter_System SHALL reduce background noise by at least 10dB
2. WHEN constant background noise is present, THE Noise_Reduction_Engine SHALL adapt to the noise profile within 2 seconds
3. WHEN speech is detected, THE Audio_Filter_System SHALL preserve speech frequencies while filtering noise
4. WHEN no speech is present, THE Audio_Filter_System SHALL analyze the noise profile for adaptive filtering

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle common audio issues like echo and reverb, so that my speech is clear even in acoustically challenging rooms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN echo or reverb is detected in the audio, THE Audio_Enhancement_Pipeline SHALL apply echo cancellation
2. WHEN room acoustics cause audio distortion, THE Audio_Filter_System SHALL compensate for reverberation effects
3. WHEN multiple reflections are present, THE Audio_Enhancement_Pipeline SHALL reduce echo artifacts by at least 6dB
4. WHEN processing audio with echo, THE Audio_Filter_System SHALL maintain speech intelligibility

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want automatic gain control and audio normalization, so that my voice is consistently audible regardless of distance from the microphone.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN my voice level varies during speech, THE Normalization_Engine SHALL maintain consistent audio levels
2. WHEN I speak too quietly, THE Audio_Filter_System SHALL amplify the signal while avoiding noise amplification
3. WHEN I speak too loudly, THE Audio_Filter_System SHALL prevent clipping and distortion
4. WHEN audio levels change rapidly, THE Normalization_Engine SHALL adapt smoothly without artifacts

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the noise filtering to work in real-time without adding significant delay, so that the speech-to-text system remains responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing audio chunks, THE Audio_Filter_System SHALL add no more than 50ms of processing delay
2. WHEN applying multiple filters, THE Audio_Enhancement_Pipeline SHALL process audio in real-time streams
3. WHEN system resources are limited, THE Audio_Filter_System SHALL gracefully reduce filter complexity
4. WHEN audio processing falls behind, THE Audio_Filter_System SHALL prioritize recent audio over older chunks

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to automatically detect and filter specific types of noise like keyboard typing, mouse clicks, and air conditioning, so that these common sounds don't interfere with transcription.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN keyboard typing sounds are detected, THE Noise_Reduction_Engine SHALL identify and suppress these transient noises
2. WHEN mouse clicks occur during speech, THE Audio_Filter_System SHALL remove click artifacts without affecting speech
3. WHEN continuous mechanical noise is present, THE Audio_Enhancement_Pipeline SHALL apply targeted frequency filtering
4. WHEN multiple noise types are present simultaneously, THE Audio_Filter_System SHALL handle overlapping noise suppression

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the noise filtering to preserve speech quality and naturalness, so that the enhanced audio doesn't sound artificial or distorted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN applying noise reduction, THE Audio_Filter_System SHALL maintain speech frequency response within 3dB of original
2. WHEN processing speech, THE Audio_Enhancement_Pipeline SHALL preserve natural speech characteristics and timbre
3. WHEN filtering aggressive noise, THE Audio_Filter_System SHALL avoid introducing audio artifacts or distortion
4. WHEN speech and noise overlap in frequency, THE Noise_Reduction_Engine SHALL prioritize speech preservation over noise removal

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the noise filtering system to integrate seamlessly with the existing speech-to-text pipeline, so that it enhances the current system without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrated with the speech-to-text system, THE Audio_Filter_System SHALL process audio before voice activity detection
2. WHEN the existing AudioCapture component provides audio chunks, THE Audio_Enhancement_Pipeline SHALL accept the same audio format
3. WHEN noise filtering is disabled, THE Audio_Filter_System SHALL pass audio through unchanged with minimal overhead
4. WHEN errors occur in filtering, THE Audio_Filter_System SHALL gracefully fallback to unfiltered audio processing

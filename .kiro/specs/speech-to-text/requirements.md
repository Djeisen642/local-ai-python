# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables the local AI application to convert real-time streaming speech from a microphone into text using local AI models through Ollama. The speech-to-text functionality will capture live audio input and provide near real-time transcription, serving as a core component for voice-based interactions with the AI assistant.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to speak into my microphone and have my speech converted to text in real-time, so that I can interact naturally with the AI system through voice commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I start the speech-to-text service THEN the system SHALL begin capturing audio from my default microphone
2. WHEN I speak into the microphone THEN the system SHALL process the audio stream and provide transcription with minimal delay
3. WHEN I stop speaking THEN the system SHALL complete the transcription of the current phrase or sentence
4. WHEN no microphone is available THEN the system SHALL provide a clear error message and graceful fallback

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to use local AI models for speech recognition, so that my voice data remains private and doesn't require internet connectivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes audio THEN it SHALL use a pre-configured locally installed Ollama model for speech recognition
2. WHEN no internet connection is available THEN the system SHALL still function properly using local models
3. WHEN the required local model is not available THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions for model installation
4. WHEN processing audio THEN the system SHALL not send any data to external services

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see my speech being transcribed in real-time as I speak, so that I can verify the accuracy and know the system is responding to my voice.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I start speaking THEN the system SHALL show that it's actively listening and processing audio
2. WHEN speech is detected THEN the system SHALL display partial transcription results as they become available
3. WHEN I pause or finish speaking THEN the system SHALL finalize and display the complete transcription
4. WHEN the microphone level changes THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback about audio input levels

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the speech-to-text functionality to be modular and testable, so that it can be easily maintained and integrated with other components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the feature THEN the system SHALL separate audio processing logic from the user interface
2. WHEN the code is written THEN it SHALL include comprehensive unit tests for all major functions
3. WHEN the module is imported THEN it SHALL provide a clean API for other components to use
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log appropriate information for debugging purposes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want voice activation detection, so that the system only processes speech when I'm actually talking and ignores background noise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is listening THEN it SHALL detect when speech begins and automatically start transcription
2. WHEN I stop speaking THEN the system SHALL detect the end of speech and finalize the current transcription
3. WHEN only background noise is present THEN the system SHALL remain in listening mode without processing
4. WHEN voice detection parameters are needed THEN the system SHALL use pre-configured constants for sensitivity and thresholds

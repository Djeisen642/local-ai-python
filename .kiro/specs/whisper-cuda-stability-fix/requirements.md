# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The speech-to-text system is experiencing fatal Python errors (segmentation faults) when running tests that involve the Whisper transcriber. The issue occurs because the optimization system automatically selects CUDA/GPU acceleration when it detects CUDA availability, but the CUDA libraries are corrupted, missing, or incompatible, causing crashes in the faster_whisper library during model initialization and transcription operations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer running tests, I want the speech-to-text system to gracefully handle CUDA library issues, so that tests don't crash with fatal Python errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CUDA libraries are corrupted or incompatible THEN the system SHALL automatically fallback to CPU-only mode
2. WHEN the system detects CUDA availability but encounters CUDA errors THEN it SHALL log the error and switch to CPU mode
3. WHEN running in CPU-only fallback mode THEN the system SHALL function normally without crashes
4. WHEN CUDA initialization fails THEN the system SHALL NOT attempt to use GPU acceleration for subsequent operations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust CUDA detection and validation, so that the system only uses GPU acceleration when it's actually working properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN detecting CUDA availability THEN the system SHALL validate that CUDA libraries can actually be loaded
2. WHEN CUDA validation fails THEN the system SHALL mark CUDA as unavailable regardless of torch.cuda.is_available()
3. WHEN CUDA libraries are missing or corrupted THEN the system SHALL detect this during validation
4. WHEN CUDA validation succeeds THEN the system SHALL safely enable GPU acceleration

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want clear logging about CUDA status and fallback decisions, so that I can understand why the system is using CPU vs GPU mode.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CUDA detection runs THEN the system SHALL log the detection results
2. WHEN CUDA validation fails THEN the system SHALL log the specific error and fallback decision
3. WHEN using CPU fallback mode THEN the system SHALL log this decision with the reason
4. WHEN CUDA is successfully enabled THEN the system SHALL log the GPU device information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the ability to force CPU-only mode, so that I can bypass CUDA issues entirely when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an environment variable FORCE_CPU_ONLY is set THEN the system SHALL use CPU mode regardless of CUDA availability
2. WHEN CPU-only mode is forced THEN the system SHALL log this decision
3. WHEN CPU-only mode is forced THEN the system SHALL NOT attempt any CUDA detection or validation
4. WHEN CPU-only mode is active THEN all transcription operations SHALL use CPU-optimized settings
